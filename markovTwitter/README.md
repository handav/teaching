In this lesson, we’ll give our bot a large input of past text that we’ve written (essays, other tweets, etc.) and, using markov chains, have it create tweets that sound like ourselves! 

If you want to use your Twitter data, download your Twitter archive at the bottom of the page at https://twitter.com/settings/account. You can also use any other body of text instead.
